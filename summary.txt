Book I, I

First paragraph: the difficulty of persuading others, especially when defending
the current state.

Paraphrase:

For anyone trying to persuade others that they are not governed as well 
as they could be, does not want attentive and favorable audience. 
Because they know the many defects that are abundant in every kind of regiment, 
but of the secret compromises and difficulties, which in public proceedings are 
numerous and inevitable, they have no judgement to consider.
And because the openly criticism to the supposed disorders of state is
considered to be good to the common benifit of all and especially to those , 
whatever they say will pass as good and current.
